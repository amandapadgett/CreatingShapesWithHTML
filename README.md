# Creading Shapes in HTML Exercise

During the second week of coding bootcamp I am taking, they asked us to use HTML to reproduce an image of circles layered on top of each other in a specific pattern. We needed to try to match the colors, shape, and positions of the circles in the model image as closely as we could. This was a fun exercise and I'm happy to say my result looks exactly like the model.
